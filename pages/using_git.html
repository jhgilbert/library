            <p>Git like magic time machine to go back to past.</p>
            <p>Git take you all the way back to before fur dress invented!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>If you've done much programming, you know that false starts are inevitable. Backtracking once you've developed
    your code in the wrong direction can be painful. That's where version control comes in.</p>

<p><em>From here on out, everything program you write or website you build should be in version control.</em> <strong>Git</strong>
    is the program you'll use locally (on your computer). <strong>GitHub</strong> is a separate but useful service that
    stores Git repositories online for you -- kind of like Flickr, but for repositories.</p>

<p>It's easy to get Git and GitHub confused or treat them as the same thing, but they aren't. You don't have to use GitHub --
    other services, like Bitbucket, are available. But GitHub is a common industry standard, so we'll go with that.</p>

<p>A few advantages of version control:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Git creates save points (known as <strong>commits</strong>) that you can roll back to.</li>
    <li>Git allows you to branch off from your code, so you can try a few different approaches simultaneously and see which works better.</li>
    <li>If you use GitHub to store your code, it's backed up safely and you won't lose it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel">
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Unless you have a paid subscription with GitHub, all of your repositories are
        viewable to the public.</p>

    <p>It's fine to build a fun project for yourself involving kittens and magic sorcerers
        (the programming community loves creativity!) but even the whimsical stuff should be kept relatively professional.
        Even if you're just writing test copy, don't make offensive or personal jokes that you wouldn't want a potential
        boss to see.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>The basic Git cycle</h2>

<p>Your most common workflow will go like this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Run <strong>git pull</strong> to make sure you're in sync with GitHub (in other words, that you have the
        most current code, as another developer could have changed it elsewhere)</li>
    <li>Create a new file, or modify an existing one</li>
    <li>Use <strong>git add [filename]</strong> in Terminal to add the changed/new file to the set of files you intend to commit
        (this is also known as <strong>staging</strong> the file)</li>
    <li>Use <strong>git commit -m "commit message"</strong> to create the actual save point</li>
    <li>Optionally, use <strong>git push</strong> to push your changes up to GitHub for online storage, but most
        programmers just do this periodically, rather than every time</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the basic loop you'll go through over and over, but you might also occasionally use other commands
    to recover from a mistake. We'll practice the basic commands first, then look at a few special cases.</p>

<p>When you decide to build a complex project, it should have its own Git repo. But for now, your entire web
    projects folder is one big repo. (So are each of your other folders, such as your database folder, etc.)</p>

<p>In other words, if you visited GitHub right now (try it!), you'd see that you have four repos -- one for
    each of your folders in /projects.</p>

<p>Because any websites you make at this stage are likely simply for learning purposes, keeping several small projects in one Git
    repo is fine. But if you decide to build a real-world website that will actually see the light of day, put it
    in its own dedicated repository. Instructions for doing that appear at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2>Some considerations</h2>
<p><strong>What dangerous commands should I avoid as a beginner?</strong></p>

<p><strong>reset</strong> and <strong>force</strong> should be used very carefully. If you're trying to solve an issue
and the solution you find online involves those commands (especially <strong>force</strong>), ask for help unless you're sure you know what you're doing.</p>

<p><strong>When <em>shouldn't</em> I add a file to my repository?</strong></p>

<p>Consider whether your repository is available to the public. If it is, avoid committing any configuration
    files that include passwords or other sensitive information.</p>

<p>Depending on your operating system and the nature of your project, other files may pop up that you should
    avoid committing. On a Mac, for instance, it's often considered best practice to avoid committing .DS_Store files
    (which are automatically created by the operating system).</p>

<p>It will take a while to get the hang of how all of this works. In the short term, focus on committing only the
    files that you have created or modified yourself. If you type 'git status' and see an untracked file you don't recognize, it may
    have been automatically created by your computer and may not belong in a repo.</p>

<p>If you would like to ignore files of a certain type, you can create a file called <strong>.gitignore</strong> in
    your directory, and add the files you'd like to avoid. You can then add and commit the .gitignore file.</p>

<p>A sample .gitignore file that could be put in any given directory on a Mac machine to avoid accidentally committing
    .DS_Store files into the repo:</p>

<h5>projects/.gitignore</h5>
<div class="panel code">
    ## Files to ignore, using * as a wildcard match<br />
    *.DS_Store
</div>

<p>If you'd like to practice, feel free to create the file above in Notepad++ and commit it to your repo.</p>

<p><strong>How do I access an older version of my code?</strong></p>

<p>Several methods will work. If you go on GitHub, you'll see that each commit has a unique identifier
    (something long and complicated, like 5da5981a813eb257e027cf38662502b5930cd0f3). <strong>git checkout [commit identifier]</strong>
    will take you back in time -- your project folder will look just as it did at the time, and your code will
    run as it did at the time. The exception is that any uncommitted local files you had hanging around in your folder
    will still be present.</p>

<p><strong>How often should I commit?</strong></p>

<p>You should commit relatively frequently. At some point, you might break your code and not notice for
    quite a while. With Git, it's easy to roll back to previous commits until you find one that isn't broken.
    If your commits are small, you'll then find it quite easy to review the bad commit to figure out
    where you went wrong.</p>

<p>If the bad commit has 5,000 changed lines in it? Not so much. Have fun finding the problem.</p>

<p>Commit anytime you get to a logical stopping place -- maybe you've just defined a new method or
    finished writing a loop. Don't get so into your code that you forget to commit for quite a long time --
    you may regret it!</p>

<p><strong>If I run git status, I see a line that says "git branch master". What does that mean?</strong></p>

<p>The master branch is the default branch of a repo. Even though we just did it in the above exercise, it's
    actually <i>not</i> a great idea to work on the master branch. Most new programmers work on the master branch
    for the sake of simplicity (and because they're not working with a team), but at a real company, the master
    branch often contains the code for the actual deployed application. You can see how it might be a bad idea
    to start committing to that code when you aren't even sure you're headed in the right direction with an idea.</p>

<p>For safety reasons, and to avoid crashing into one another in terms of working on the same code at the same time,
    developers will typically branch off from master, develop a feature, and merge the code back into master
    when the feature is complete, tested, and ready to go.</p>

<p>If this idea confuses you, think of it as pulling off the racetrack to fix up your car, rather than
    trying to fix it while still racing on the track. It's safer to remove yourself from the race,
    improve your car (or section of the website), verify that everything is running smoothly, and then merge back in.</p>

<p>For now, it's up to you whether to work on master. Instructions for getting fancy and creating your own
    branch are at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p><strong>I made a mistake in my last commit and want to fix it.</strong></p>

<p>You can amend a commit by making the desired changes, adding the modified files to staging, and then
    running <strong>git commit --amend -m "New commit message"</strong>. Git has a ton of tricks like that --
    almost too many!</p>

<hr />

<h2>How to Branch</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, it's best to make a new branch anytime you're doing new work on an existing project. This
involves just a few additional steps.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the directory of the project you'd like to work on</li>
    <li>Run <strong>git checkout -b new_branch_name</strong> to create and check out your new branch -- the name can
        reflect whatever you intend to do, such as <strong>css_tweaks</strong> or <strong>database_upgrades</strong>.</li>
    <li>Run <strong>git status</strong> to verify that you are on the desired branch.</li>
    <li>Work on your project, adding and committing files as you go. If you want to push your new branch to GitHub
    at any point, <strong>git push origin new_branch_name</strong> will take care of that.</li>
    <li>When you've reached a good stopping place and everything is working well, you can merge back into master (or
        whichever branch you're merging back into) by running <strong>git checkout master</strong> to check out
        the master branch, and then <strong>git merge new_branch_name</strong> to pull in changes.</li>
    <li>Running <strong>git branch</strong> will show you a list of branches, with a star by the name of the one
    you are currently on.</li>
    <li>If you've finished with your new branch and would like to delete it, run <strong>git branch -D new_branch_name</strong>
        to clean up after yourself. (If you pushed to GitHub, you will need to delete the branch on GitHub as well.) That's it!</li>
</ol>
