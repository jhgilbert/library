            <p>Terminal like dark forest with no flametorch.</p>
            <p>... Don't worry, wild boar probably can't smell you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Terminal</strong> is also known as the <strong>Bash shell</strong>, plain old <strong>Bash</strong> (technically,
    Bash is the language you're using to communicate with Terminal),
    or <strong>the command line</strong>.</p>

<p>There are subtle differences between these terms, but the only thing you really need to understand for now
    is that when you need to Google how to do something on the command line, any of these terms may pop up in
    the answers you see.</p>

<p>Terminal is a way of communicating more directly with your computer. You're used to using software that uses graphics,
    colors, menus, and other fancy things. Terminal's interface is much simpler, but the program itself is extremely powerful.</p>

<p>Case in point: Simply typing <strong>rm -rf /</strong> into Terminal can <em>wipe out your computer</em>. The <strong>rm -rf</strong> command
    is so potentially dangerous even among tech professionals that it was once responsible for wiping out 90% of <i>Toy Story 2</i>. <a href="http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/27/movie-legends-revealed-was-toy-story-2-nearly-deleted/">True story!</a></p>

<p>So, hey, don't do that, and be wary of any Terminal command you see in a forum where someone might be
    messing with you. Places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> are well moderated (if a bit cranky
    at times) and shouldn't cause that problem.</p>

<p>Don't worry, most Terminal commands are safe. Just be very careful with <strong>sudo</strong>, <strong>rm</strong>,
    and <strong>rm -rf</strong>. If you aren't sure a Terminal command is a good idea, ask for help.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What can you do with Terminal?</h2>

<p>Here are a few things you might eventually want to do with Terminal:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Search for, and rename, every file on your system that matches a certain filename</li>
    <li>Create files or folders in batches</li>
    <li>Run Ruby programs</li>
    <li>Search for information in a database</li>
    <li>Communicate with a server or other remote machine</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no getting around it: If you become a professional programmer, you'll be working in Terminal.
    Using Terminal can be frustrating at first, but eventually you'll appreciate its speed, power, and simplicity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Opening Terminal</h2>

<p>Click the <strong>Terminal</strong> shortcut on your environment desktop.</p>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<img src="../img/terminal1.png" />

<p>Scroll down to a set of files that all start with Terminal and then have a letter:</p>

<img src="../img/terminal2.png" />

<p>Run the file that matches your USB drive letter, which varies from machine to machine. Note that in the screenshot
    above, the drive letter is F: (my USB disk is called PATRIOT, and it's listed as F: on the lefthand side), so I would
    run <strong>Terminal F</strong>.</p>

<p>When you open the file, a black box will appear, and some odd stuff might happen for a moment, or the box may just
    sit there for a moment. But eventually, you should get a dollar-sign prompt that looks something like this:</p>

<img src="../img/terminal3.png" />

<p>That's it. That's all Terminal does. Bit of a letdown, no?</p>

<p>Note that your prompt will look a bit different -- I'm Jennifer Gilbert and I'm using a computer named Brodie,
    which is why that information appears in the screenshot.</p>

<p>Anyway, you're now ready to use Terminal. Congratulations!</p>

<p>Try the commands in each lesson in order. Anywhere you see "???" instead of a command, it's your job to guess the right one.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1: Folder Basics</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>COMMAND</td>
        <td>EXPLANATION</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>pwd</td>
        <td><strong>pwd</strong> prints your working directory, so you know where you are. Terminal will probably tell you that
            you're in a user folder -- something like <strong>/home/Jennifer Gilbert</strong>. You don't want that, because your username
            may vary at another computer, which means you'll have trouble accessing anything you put in this directory
            if you switch computers later. Let's get out of here!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd&nbsp;/projects</td>
        <td><strong>cd</strong> means "change directory", and we've switched to /projects. You'll spend lots of time in this folder --
            it's the one linked from your environment desktop (listed there as <strong>Your Projects</strong>).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ls</td>
        <td><strong>ls</strong> stands for "list", and it helps you see the files and folders in a directory. You
            should see several rather obviously named folders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd&nbsp;ruby_projects</td>
        <td>There's <strong>cd</strong> again, for "change directory."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>How can you take a look around in this folder? It's one of the commands you've already used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ruby&nbsp;sample_ruby_program.rb</td>
        <td>When you listed the contents of the ruby_projects directory, you found a program in there. You can
            use <strong>ruby</strong> and then the program name to run it ("Ruby, please run the program that has this filename").
            The output we get from the program is pretty much nonsense, so, no, you're not having a stroke.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd&nbsp..</td>
        <td>This is how you move up one directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ruby&nbsp;ruby_projects/sample_ruby_program.rb</td>
        <td>Hey, look at that -- you can still run the Ruby program, but you had to type a little more information
            in order to point Terminal to the file. File locations are relative in Terminal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Can you figure out how to change to the web_projects directory?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>List the files and folders in the web_projects directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd&nbsp;sample_project</td>
        <td>Helpful tip: You could have just typed "cd sam" and then hit the Tab key. Tab will autocomplete
            a path as long as you've typed enough to make it unique.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br />
<h3>Lesson 2: A Pretend Web Project</h3>

<p>You can use Terminal to create, edit, and delete files, though you can also accomplish the same thing in the
    graphical user interface (GUI) that you're used to dealing with (you know, the one with the cute little icons).</p>

<p>Believe it or not, if you stick with Terminal, you'll eventually find it faster and more convenient. While Terminal
    won't replace your GUI on your own machine (especially when it comes to editing code),
    it's often all you have to interact with when communicating with a remote machine, so it's important to practice
    using it when you can.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>COMMAND</td>
        <td>EXPLANATION</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cd /projects</td>
        <td>There's that familiar command -- it'll take you to your projects folder from any directory in Terminal.
            Just like clicking your heels together three times!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>List the contents of your current directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Change your working directory to the sample_project folder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Take a look around the sample_project folder. These files look familiar -- it's just a basic web project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>less&nbsp;index.html</td>
        <td>It's a pain to have to open files all the time -- <strong>less</strong> lets you just take a quick
            peek. When you're done looking around in index.html, <strong>q</strong> will exit you out of <strong>less</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Hm, I've forgotten where we are. Can you print your working directory in order to check?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>We don't want to be in the sample_project directory anymore. Can you move one level up?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>mkdir&nbsp;new_project</td>
        <td>Terminal lets you create directories. We've just made a folder called new_project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Change your working directory so you're inside of new_project. For bonus points, use Tab to
            autocomplete your destination.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>touch&nbsp;index.html</td>
        <td><strong>touch</strong> is like mkdir, but for individual files. You just made a blank file called index.html.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>echo 'hello there!'</td>
        <td>Well, that was silly -- we just got Terminal to say something, like you would with <strong>print</strong>
            or <strong>puts</strong>. Note that single quotes are often safer than double quotes because they're more literal in Terminal --
            if you used double quotes to run this command, you probably got a weird error. Double quotes are more flexible -- they
            allow you to use variables and such within them. Single quotes mean "Just echo exactly what I said. Don't get fancy." But anyway,
            what's the point of getting Terminal to print something?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>echo&nbsp;'This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;brand&nbsp;new&nbsp;page!'&nbsp;>>&nbsp;index.html</td>
        <td>Now you're fancy. You just printed something directly into your index.html file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Take a quick peek at the contents of index.html to confirm that you did in fact print words into it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999</td>
        <td>You may get a firewall warning from Windows on this one, but it's perfectly safe -- click "Allow Access."
            Abandon Terminal for a moment and pop open Chrome. Point your browser to <strong>localhost:9999</strong>.
            Look familiar? Hit refresh a few times, and watch what happens in Terminal. You're running a small local web server
            (local meaning that it's not available outside of your own computer),
            and what you're seeing each time you hit refresh is the GET request coming from your browser, and your server
            fulfilling that request (hopefully successfully, in which case you will see the code 200, which means OK).
            Try going to <strong>localhost:9999/another_page.html</strong>. What happens then? The browser gets an error
            response from Terminal, and you can see in Terminal that the browser submitted a GET request for /another_page.html,
            which Terminal was unable to find, because that file does not exist in your new_project folder. If it did, Terminal
            would happily serve it!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ctrl+C</td>
        <td>This combination of keys is a common way to exit out of something in Terminal that you can't otherwise
            escape from -- if you ever write a bad loop in Ruby that runs forever, Ctrl+C will get you out of that jam.
            Other common methods of quitting are <strong>Ctrl+D</strong>, <strong>q</strong>, and <strong>exit</strong>.
            It's not weird to have to try a few of them before you wrestle yourself free! At any rate, you just stopped your
            server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Where are you? Print your working directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>List the contents of your current directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>rm index.html</td>
        <td>That file was fun to play with, but we don't really need it anymore. Let's get rid of it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>Move up one directory.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>???</td>
        <td>List the contents of your current directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>rmdir new_project</td>
        <td>Come to think of it, let's just get rid of the new_project folder altogether.</td>
    </tr>

<h3>Lesson 3: It's Challenge Time</h3>

<div class="panel jane">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="large-3 columns">
            <img src="../img/jane.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="large-9 columns">
            <h5 class="jane">JANE SAY:</h5><br />
            <p>Cloud God gave you Reading Eyes for reason.</p>
            <p>Don't be Neanderthal! If Terminal give you output, read it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Terminal is capable of running very complicated commands, but you'll likely use the same basic ones over and over.
    <strong>pwd</strong>, <strong>cd</strong>, <strong>ls</strong>, <strong>touch</strong>, and <strong>ruby</strong> are all safe to use -- worst
    case, you'll just get an error, but you won't break anything. Use <strong>rmdir</strong> and <strong>rm</strong> more carefully.</p>

<p><strong>rm -rf [directoryname]</strong>, which is used to delete a directory that is not empty (<strong>rmdir</strong> will not work on a directory
that contains files), should be used most carefully of all.</p>

<p>I know Jane just told you, but <strong>read your output</strong>. Plenty of students will blindly follow
    instructions without paying attention to the feedback that Terminal is giving. If you've mistyped a command,
    you don't want to miss the "command not found" error that Terminal helpfully gave you, and then stumble ahead and wonder
    several commands later why you're having trouble.</p>

<p>Here's your challenge:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Close out of Terminal if you have it open.</li>
    <li>Run Terminal again.</li>
    <li>Create a new Ruby program in your ruby_projects folder using just Terminal. The program can be extremely simple.</li>
    <li>Run the program.</li>
    <li>Delete the program.</li>
    <li>Working within the same Terminal window, create a new web project in the appropriate place (again, it can be very simple).</li>
    <li>Run your new web project using SimpleHTTPServer, and visit it in your browser.</li>
</ol>
